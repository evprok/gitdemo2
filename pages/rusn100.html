<h1>RUSN 100: Reading@Russia</h1>

<p>The goal of this course is to explore reading as a social practice and text as an evolving unit of
knowledge. We use folk, literary and visual texts from and about Russia, on the one hand, to
develop students’ analytical close reading skills, on the other hand, to familiarize the students
with the concept and tools of distant reading. Students will get practice with computational tools
of digital humanities to analyze datasets ranging from digitized copies of literary texts to sets
drawn from social media.</p>
