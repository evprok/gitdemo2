  <h4>Russian 309: Course Overview</h4>
  
   <p>
     The origins of animation and cinematic fantasy are inextricably linked: both originated in the early 1900s out of artistsâ€™ desire to transcend realism, to tweak and expand reality. This course will introduce students to Russo-Soviet fantasy cinema and animation from their beginnings through the present. We will discuss such topics as early cinematic experimentation, cinema and national identity, cinematic propaganda, utopia & dystopia, cinematic fantasy and nostalgia, etc.
Films will be considered within socio-political, aesthetic and theoretical contexts.
Students will learn about the major periods of twentieth and twenty-first-century Soviet and Russian culture (revolutionary culture, Stalinism, Thaw, Stagnation, Perestroika, and the new Russian cinema) and discuss cinema as an intersection of political and cultural ideas of the time.
